This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.  

## Labs/Projects
* [Navigation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p1_navigation): In the first project, you will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.
* [Continuous Control](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p2_continuous-control): In the second project, you will train an robotic arm to reach target locations.
* [Collaboration and Competition](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p3_collab-compet): In the third project, you will train a pair of agents to play tennis!
